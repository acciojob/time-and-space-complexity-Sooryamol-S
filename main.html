    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the size of the input. It is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, with the goal of optimizing performance. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms and predicting their behavior in large-scale applications.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> deals with the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It provides a measure of the extra space or memory required by an algorithm beyond the input data. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <i>O(n)</i> indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
