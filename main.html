   <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm efficient. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space.</p>
